## About Me  
Hi there 👋 I'm **Daniel Zhang**, a software development student at **MITT (Manitoba Institute of Trades and Technology)**.  
I’m passionate about building responsive web apps, designing clean UI layouts, and improving my problem-solving skills through real projects.  
Outside of coding, I’m also a competitive FPS player who loves optimizing performance both in-game and in code.

## My skills  
- 💻 **Languages:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, SQL  
- 🧩 **Frameworks & Tools:** React, Node.js, Express, Git, VS Code  
- 🗄️ **Database:** MySQL, SQL Server  
- 🎨 **UI/UX:** Responsive design, accessibility, and clean layouts  
- ⚙️ **Other Interests:** Web performance, API integration, and game analytics


## My status  
- 🌱 Currently learning **full-stack web development**  
- 🧠 Working on improving **JavaScript and database logic**  
- 🎯 Goal: Build a personal gaming analytics dashboard website  
- 💬 Ask me about coding, gaming, or productivity tips! 

## Fun Fact  
When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me training my aim in Valorant or CS2. I’ve always believed that debugging code and mastering flick shots share the same mindset — focus, patience, and rhythm. A cup of black coffee usually powers both my late-night commits and my perfect headshots.
